Although we cannot predict when exactly the quantum computer is ready to launch attacks on Asymmetric cryptography, the current threat is the so called "harvest now, decrypt later". This means that some critical data can be kept by hackers now, and they will get all those sensitive data in plaintext when the quantum computer is available. 

Goverment agencies, banks, telecommunications, automotive industry, are among the examples that are worried about this vulnerability. To mitigate this, post quantum cryptography is currently urgent need to deploy on classical computers so that critical data intercepted now cannot be attacked even in the era of quantum computers.
